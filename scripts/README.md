# Scripts 

These notebooks implement the idea presented in the paper [Universal Differential Equations for Scientific Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04385). Further, it showcases an attempt to extend the approach for higher dimensional LV systems.

# Dependencies 

The notebooks use [NODEData.jl](https://github.com/maximilian-gelbrecht/NODEData.jl) for loading batches of data which is (so far) not in the general registry, please install it from the repository.
